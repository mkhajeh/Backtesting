# Backtesting

In this project, I built a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester  performed portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, and I implemented it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. I also used performance attribution to identify the major drivers of your portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL).

This project was the eighth project (out of Eight Projects) in **AI for trading NanoDegree Program**, offered by Udacity. The rest of projects could be found in my GitHub Page as well.
